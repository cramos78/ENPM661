# Given a predefined map, convert to binary map to determine obstacle space (point robot radius = 0, obstacle clearance = 0)



# Obtaining Input from user : Start Point and Goal Point



# Check feasibility of  User Input : For start or goal nodes in obstacle space or outside range of binary map, inform user to redefine points try again



# Implement Djikstra's Algorithm



# Implementing Backtracking (once goal node is achieved) 



# Using pygame implement animation of optimal path generation
